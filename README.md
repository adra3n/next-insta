## Next Insta Social Media App

## Introduction

I create a simple social media app with the some project requirements. My main tasks were:
- To handle the browser refresh action and reroute to a specific page with Next.js.
- To create a modal look without using any Modal libraries.
- Style with libraries like TailwindCSS instead of using pre-built components
- Not to use pre-built components for features like buttons, modals, etc. Build these components from scratch.

## Features

- Next.js dynamic routes
- Clicking a post will open a modal and when user refreshes the browser client will reroute to this post's details page.
- Comment and like feature

- Using Redux slices to handle states and actions
