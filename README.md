## Next Insta Social Media App

## Introduction

I prepared a MVP project based on previously given tasks.

My main tasks were:
- Handling the browser refresh action and rerouting to a specific page with Next.js.
- Creating a modal look without using any Modal libraries.
- Styling with libraries like Tailwind CSS instead of using pre-built components.
- Not using pre-built components for features like buttons, modals, etc. Building these components from scratch.


## Features

- Next.js dynamic routes
- Clicking a post will open a modal and when user refreshes the browser client will reroute to this post's details page.
- Comment and like feature
- Search posts and users
- User profile pages
- Post pages with the feature to show similar posts of user
- Responsive design
- Using Redux slices to handle states and actions
